# Pedigree-Plotting-Script

For plotting pedigrees in Cranefoot as Scott Frodsham recommended. Most of the code is just formatting the ped files into the format that the pedigree software accepts. The code for the actual plotting is short and straightforward. Another plotting software that we have used a little, prior to my time, is kinship which is very easy to use. More plotting scripts can be found by searching on box.
